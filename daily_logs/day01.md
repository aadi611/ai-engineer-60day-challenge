# Day 1 - February 21, 2026

## Topics Covered
- Search Fundamentals (Keyword & Vector Search)
- Embeddings and Vector Representations
- Semantic Search
- Similarity Metrics (Cosine & Dot Product)
- RAG Pipeline Architecture
- Re-Ranking with Cross-Encoders
- Hybrid Search Approaches
- Chunking Strategies

## What I Learned

- **Keyword vs Vector Search**: Understanding the difference between traditional keyword-based search and modern vector-based semantic search

- **Embeddings**: How text is converted into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning

- **Semantic Search**: Search based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches
- **Similarity Metrics**: 
  - Cosine Similarity: Measures angle between vectors
  - Dot Product: Measures magnitude and direction alignment

- **Retrieval Ranking**: Methods to rank and order search results by relevance

- **Step-by-Step RAG Pipeline**: The complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation workflow from query to response

- **Re-Ranking with Cross-Encoders**: 
  - Critical for production use cases in medical, legal, and enterprise domains
  - Cross-encoders provide more accurate relevance scoring by examining query-document pairs jointly
  - Particularly valuable when precision is crucial

- **Hybrid Search**: Combining keyword and vector search for better results

- **Chunking Strategies**: Different approaches to breaking down documents for efficient retrieval
