# Capstone: Enterprise Copilot

## Overview

The capstone project brings together all concepts from the 60-day challenge into a production-ready enterprise AI copilot.

## Structure

- `api/` - FastAPI backend and REST endpoints
- `agents/` - Multi-agent orchestration system
- `retrieval/` - Production RAG implementation
- `monitoring/` - Observability and metrics
- `optimization/` - Cost and performance optimization
- `deployment/` - Azure deployment configurations

## Features

- Multi-agent orchestration with LangGraph
